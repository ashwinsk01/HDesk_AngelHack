## Overview
This repository contains the source code for Spotlight, a community-driven platform developed during the AngelHack 24-hour hackathon by Team SGVscERlc2s= [(HelpDesk encoded in base64 :)]. Our application allows users to post problems, upvote them based on urgency and relevance, submit solutions, and engage with investors who can fund promising solutions.

## Features
- **Problem Submission:** Users can post problems they are encountering around their community.
- **Upvote (spots) System:** Community members vote on problems to prioritize them.
- **Solution Submission:** Users propose solutions to prioritized problems.
- **Investor Dashboard:** Investors review top problems and solutions to make funding decisions.

## User Segmentation
- **Community Members:** Engage in posting, voting, and discussing solutions.
- **Solution Providers:** Develop and submit solutions, interacting with feedback.
- **Investors:** Evaluate and invest in solutions with high community and expert ratings.

## Technology Stack
- **Figma:** Used for UI/UX design and wireframing.
- **Gemma 2B:** Employs lightweight natural language processing capabilities.
- **Xano:** Manages backend processes, database operations, and API integrations.
- **Bravo Studio:** Converts Figma designs into functional app prototypes.
- **Python:** Handles scripting, training models, and running automated tests.
- **Airtable:** Used as a fast DB with easy operability.

## Reason for Technology Shift
We initially considered using Cohere for its advanced NLP capabilities. However, due to its resource-intensive nature, we opted for Gemma 2B as a more lightweight alternative. Cohere's integration is still part of our future roadmap when we scale our infrastructure to support more complex NLP tasks.

## Setup Instructions
